# Helpers

SACSS does not cover all styles, the following four projects commonly used styles, SACSS provides the corresponding Mixin for the convenience of users.

Here it is recommended to use function-based **semantic** names, so there is no SACSS naming convention here.

|Name|Function|
|:----|----:|
|`Clearfix`| Clears floats of floats |
|`Ellipsis`| single line of text beyond the display of `... ` |
|`Ellipsis-multiple`| multi-line text out of display `... `
|`Cell`|Fill the remaining space in the floating layout|

Note that when you have a uniform naming prefix, it is recommended to add the uniform prefix to the code here as well.

``` less
@import 'sacss/less/Helpers.less';

.clearfix{ #Clearfix;  }
.ellipsis{ #Ellipsis;  }
.cell{ #Cell; }
.ellipsis-mul{ #Ellipsis-multiple;  }
.ellipsis-mul._2row{ -webkit-line-clamp: 2; }
```

``` html
<div class="fs12 lh16 ellipsis">
    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.
</div>
<div class="fs12 lh16 ellipsis-mul _2row">
    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.
</div>
<div class="clearfix">
    <div class="fl mr16">float-left</div>
